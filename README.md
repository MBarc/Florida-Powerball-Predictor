# üé∞ Florida Powerball Predictor üé∞

An automated Powerball number prediction system that analyzes historical lottery data to generate predictions and sends notifications when jackpots exceed $1 billion.

## Features

- **Historical Data Collection**: Scrapes 10+ years of Powerball results from official website
- **Frequency-Based Predictions**: Generates number predictions based on historical frequency patterns
- **Smart Notifications**: Automatically sends push notifications via IFTTT when jackpots exceed $1B
- **Automated Monitoring**: Checks current jackpot amounts and triggers predictions accordingly

## System Flow

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection** (`dataGatherer.py`): Uses Selenium to scrape historical Powerball results
2. **Prediction Engine** (`predictNumbers.py`): Analyzes number frequencies to generate predictions
3. **Jackpot Monitoring** (`main.py`): Checks current jackpot and triggers system when threshold is met
4. **Notifications** (`notifier.py`): Sends predictions via IFTTT webhooks

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/powerball-predictor.git
cd powerball-predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example Output

```
Current Jackpot: $1.40 Billion
Jackpot exceeds $1B, generating prediction...

Reached 10 years of data: 2014-12-15 00:00:00
White balls: [12, 23, 44, 57, 61] Powerball: 18
IFTTT notification sent successfully!
```

## Technical Details

### Data Collection Strategy
- Scrapes official Powerball website for maximum accuracy
- Collects 10+ years of historical results automatically
- Handles dynamic loading with Selenium automation

### Prediction Algorithm
- Analyzes frequency patterns of white balls (1-69) and Powerball numbers (1-26)
- Uses weighted random sampling based on historical occurrence rates
- **Note**: This is for entertainment purposes only - lottery numbers are random!

### Notification System
- Integrates with IFTTT for flexible notification options
- Only triggers when jackpots exceed $1 billion threshold
- Customizable message format and delivery methods
